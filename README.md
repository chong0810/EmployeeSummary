# Description

This is a Command Line Interface application that can create an organization tree for a user's organization. It creates simple but well organized cards to show an organization tree. This application has taught me how to use node.js to an advanced level and challenged me to use jest to continuously check my codes and make sure I meet the requirements for each phase.
